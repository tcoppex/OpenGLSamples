	</div>
   <h3>Release 2.11 (March 2015):</h3>
   <p>Release 2.11 is a Major release, focusing on Android TV support and Path Rendering samples.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <b>Android TV Support:</b> The samples now support Android TV, including the use of controller to activate and navigate the tweak bar.  The "A" button will open the tweak bar and the "B" button will close it.  DPAD navigates and A/B select and step back.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Cursive ES demonstrates the use of GPU path rendering to draw a freeform stroke font, animating as if it is being written on screen.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Shaped Text ES render uses GPU path rendering to draw more advanced fonts.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Text Wheel ES shows how to use freeform rotations of fonts rendered with GPU paths.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Tiger 3D ES renders both path elements and 3D elements in the same scene, including depth buffering   .
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Tiger Warp ES shows how objects drawn using path rendering can have general projective transformations applied to them.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>Known Bug:</b> Compute Particles and Weighted Blended OIT have incorrect controller step sizes on their sliders.  Thus, controller UI for these sliders is not working.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>Known Bug:</b> Compute Water Surface "steals" the A button, and the app does not deploy the tweak bar.  Thus, controller UI for the tweak bar is not working.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>Known Bug:</b> Tiger 3D ES and Tiger Warp ES do not have full controls available via the controller.
     </li>
   </ul>       

   <h3>Release 2.0 (Sept 2014):</h3>
   <p>Release 2.0 is a Major release, focusing on GeForce Maxwell-level GPU features.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <b>Layout Change:</b> The samples are now grouped by common feature set.  Currently, this means that the samples are grouped by GPU level and API.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Blended AA shows how to use Target-independent Rendering (TIR) to lower the memory requirements for antialising.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Cascaded Shadow Mapping shows how to use Viewport Multicasting and Fast Geometry Shaders to optimize the performance of Cascaded Shadow Mapping.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Conservative Rasterization Sample demonstrates the basics of hardware-based Conservative Rasterization, a method of ensuring that every pixel touched by geometry is shaded, independent of sample coverage.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Normal Blended Decal Sample demonstrates the use of Pixel Shader Interlock (PSI) to implement fast, safe custom blending.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Weighted Blended OIT Sample demonstrates fast Order-Independent Transparency (OIT) via the methods based on a modified blending equation.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New API:</b> The app framework now supports three redraw modes: Unbounded (the previous method), VSYNC (apps are given draw calls on each VSYNC or compositor redraw; optional) and on-demand (only when the app requests).
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New API:</b> Wrappers are now provided to make it easier for apps to compile against OpenGL ES 3.1 AEP.
     </li>

       <b>New API:</b> Wrappers are now provided to make it easier for apps to compile against OpenGL ES 3.1 AEP.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New API:</b> Applications can now request MSAA support in their configuration callback.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>Bug Fix:</b> OpenGL extension-string checking is now more robust.
     </li>
   </ul>       
   <h3>Release 1.2 (June 2014):</h3>
   <p>Release 1.2 is a feature release with no known "breaking" changes.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <b>New Platform:</b> Linux for Tegra (a full Ubuntu desktop on Tegra platforms) support has been added for all samples.  The samples now run on NVIDIA Jetson TK1.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Compute Particles shows how to use Compute Shaders and buffer interop to use the GPU to animate and render particles without CPU involvement.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Compute Water Surface shows how to use Compute Shaders to generate a dynamic water surface with ripples and reflections.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> FXAA demonstrates a simple, high-performance and easy-to-integrate antialiasing method as a 2D post-process.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> HDR demonstrates tonemapping, cinematic flares and refraction.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Multi Draw Indirect demonstrates OpenGL performance features known as Approaching Zero Driver Overhead ("AZDO").
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Optimization App demonstrates CPU and GPU timers for app-level profiling as well as switchable, basic optimization techniques.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New Sample:</b> Soft Shadows demonstrates multiple projected texture methods, including multi-sampled penumbrae.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b>New API:</b> The app framework now includes a function to query whether a GL context is bound, NvPlatformContext::isContextBound().
     </li>
   </ul>
   
     <h3>Release 1.01 (May 2014):</h3>
   Release 1.01 is (as its version implies) a bugfix release with no known "breaking" changes.
	<ul>
		<li>OpenGL ES3.1 contexts are now supported.  There is also a default ES3.1 context version object: NvGfxAPIVersionES3_1.</li>
    <li>Some bugs in the EGL setup code and the image-loading code that caused ES3.1 contexts not to work are now fixed.  All samples that can support ES2 or ES3 now work if the app requests ES3.1 as well.</li>
    <li>The min-API and missing extension error dialogs now include more descriptive strings to explain to the user what was found and what is needed.</li>
    <li>The image loader now auto-expands DXT textures to RGBA on systems without DXT support.</li>
    <li>The UI system now handles window resize correctly on platforms with windowed mode.</li>
    <li>Android's NDK r9d is now the default NDK version when building Android apps from Linux host.</li>
    <li>NvGLSLProgram::bindTexture2D was not setting the texture on the correct (passed in) texture unit.  This has been fixed.</li>
    <li>Log-based framerate printing has been disabled by default, since it is printed to the screen.</li>
    <li>A typo in the default window size on Win32 has been fixed (window size is now 1280 pixels wide instead of 1270).</li>
    <li>The period (.) key is now mapped on Linux and Win32 platforms.</li>
  </ul>
   
   <h3>Release 1.0 (March 2014):</h3>
   Release 1.0 is the first version of the new samples pack.
